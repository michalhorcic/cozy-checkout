## PROJECT RULES & CODING STANDARDS

*   When designing databases, implement soft deletes using a `deleted_at` column of type `:utc_datetime` and create an index on this column. When setting the `deleted_at` timestamp, use `DateTime.truncate(utc_datetime, :second)` (available in Elixir v1.6+) to remove microseconds.
*   Capture the price and VAT rate at the time of purchase in the `order_items` table to ensure accurate historical records.
*   Ensure all tables include `inserted_at` and `updated_at` timestamps.
*   When creating a database table, every table with soft deletes should also have an index on the `deleted_at` column.
*   When designing a database related to financial transactions, capture the VAT rate at the time of purchase to ensure accurate historical records.
*   When creating a database table, use `binary_id` for primary key and foreign key columns.
*   When creating a database table, create unique index for columns with unique values.
*   When creating a database table, name indexes for foreign keys according to `[:column_name]` convention.
*   When creating products, include a `unit` field (e.g., "ml", "L", "pcs") to indicate what type of measurement they use. This field should be nullable.
*   Add `unit_amount` (decimal) to `order_items` to store the size of each unit (e.g., 500 for 0.5L).
*   Products should have a `default_unit_amounts` (text/jsonb, nullable) field for optional preset amounts like [300, 500, 1000].
*   When implementing soft delete functions, always use `DateTime.truncate(utc_datetime, :second)` to remove microseconds to ensure compatibility with the `:utc_datetime` field type in Ecto.
*   When displaying order items in the POS system and admin CRUD interfaces, group items visually by product and unit amount. The database should maintain individual `order_items` records. Allow staff to expand the grouped items to view and delete individual items. Group deletion is disabled in the POS system; only individual item deletion is allowed.
*   Make the currency configurable and default to CZK. The currency configuration should be kept in code.
*   **Always** use the `format_currency/1` helper function from `CozyCheckoutWeb.CurrencyHelper` to format currency values in templates and LiveViews. **Never** hardcode currency symbols like `$` or `â‚¬` directly in templates.
*   The currency symbol is configured in `CozyCheckoutWeb.CurrencyHelper` (default: "CZK"). To change the currency, modify the `@currency_symbol` module attribute in that file.
*   Separate the `guests` table into two tables: one for `guests` (as persons who may visit the cottage multiple times) and another for `bookings` (actual stays at the cottage). Link payments to both the `bookings` table and to the `guest` table.
*   The `guests` table should have the following columns:
    *   `id` (binary_id, primary key)
    *   `name` (string, required)
    *   `email` (string, nullable, unique)
    *   `phone` (string, nullable)
    *   `notes` (text, nullable) - preferences, allergies, etc.
    *   `inserted_at`, `updated_at`
    *   `deleted_at` (soft delete)
*   The `bookings` table (Stays/Visits) should have the following columns:
    *   `id` (binary_id, primary key)
    *   `guest_id` (binary_id, foreign key â†’ guests)
    *   `room_number` (string, nullable)
    *   `check_in_date` (date, required)
    *   `check_out_date` (date, nullable)
    *   `status` (string: "upcoming", "active", "completed", "cancelled")
    *   `notes` (text, nullable) - stay-specific notes
    *   `inserted_at`, `updated_at`
    *   `deleted_at` (soft delete)
*   The `orders` table should:
    *   Keep `guest_id` for quick reference, but make it nullable.
    *   Add `booking_id` (binary_id, foreign key â†’ bookings), but make it nullable.
    *   Add `name` field (string, nullable).
    *   This way orders are linked to both the guest AND the specific stay
*   The `payments` table should remain linked to orders (which are already linked to bookings).
*   Add a `bookings.status` field to distinguish:
    *   `"upcoming"` - future bookings
    *   `"active"` - currently checked in
    *   `"completed"` - checked out
    *   `"cancelled"` - cancelled bookings
*   Consider adding to guests table:
    *   `preferred_payment_method` (string, nullable)
    *   `loyalty_tier` (string, nullable) - for future loyalty programs
    *   `total_stays` (integer, default 0) - cached count
*   Add unique index on `(guest_id, check_in_date)` to prevent double bookings
*   Implement the ability to import bookings from iCal files (.ics). The import process should:
    *   Parse the iCal file to extract guest names, dates, contact info, and notes from each VEVENT.
    *   Create or find guests, matching by name/email, or creating new guests if no match is found.
    *   Create bookings with the extracted information.
*   In the POS order management, when creating a new order, show a modal:
    *   "Who is this order for?"
    *   Quick buttons: "Main Guest", "Partner", "Kids", "Other"
    *   Text input for custom name
*   Display the order name in the order selection screen (e.g., "ðŸ“‹ Order #001 (Dad) - $25.50").
*   Implement a `booking_guests` join table to track all people in a booking:
    *   `id` (binary_id, primary key)
    *   `booking_id` (binary_id, foreign key â†’ bookings, on_delete: :delete_all)
    *   `guest_id` (binary_id, foreign key â†’ guests, on_delete: :delete_all)
    *   `is_primary` (boolean, default: false) - indicates the primary guest who pays for accommodation.
    *   `inserted_at`, `updated_at`
*   When creating a booking, a `booking_guest` record must be automatically created for the primary guest (the person paying for accommodation). The `is_primary` field should be set to `true`.
*   Users should be able to add more guests to every booking via a separate "Manage Guests" section in the admin area.
*   When adding additional guests to a booking, the system should allow selecting from existing guests in the database or creating new guests on the fly.
*   In the booking list/calendar view, only the primary guest should be shown for now.
*   Users should be able to remove additional guests from a booking, but not the primary guest.
*   Add a `rooms` table with the following columns:
    *   `id` (binary_id, primary key)
    *   `room_number` (string, required, unique)
    *   `name` (string, nullable)
    *   `description` (text, nullable)
    *   `capacity` (integer, required)
    *   `inserted_at`, `updated_at`
    *   `deleted_at` (soft delete)
*   Add a `booking_rooms` join table to track rooms associated with each booking:
    *   `id` (binary_id, primary key)
    *   `booking_id` (binary_id, foreign key â†’ bookings, on_delete: :delete_all)
    *   `room_id` (binary_id, foreign key â†’ rooms, on_delete: :delete_all)
    *   `inserted_at`, `updated_at`
*   The system should prevent double-booking the same room for overlapping dates.
*   The system should enforce that the number of guests in a booking doesn't exceed the total capacity of all booked rooms.
*   Rooms will have different prices, and pricing will be handled per room.
*   Room management should appear in the admin section for CRUD operations.
*   During booking creation/editing, staff should select rooms via a modal. There will be just 13 rooms in our case.
*   In the calendar view and booking list, show the specific room numbers that are booked.
*   If a room's details (name, capacity) change, bookings should retain the room information as it was at booking time.
*   Create a `booking_invoices` table to store the invoicing details. The table should have the following columns:
    *   `id` (binary_id, primary key)
    *   `booking_id` (binary_id, foreign key â†’ bookings, on_delete: :delete_all), null: false
    *   `adult_count` (integer, required)
    *   `kids_under_2_count` (integer, default: 0)
    *   `kids_under_12_count` (integer, default: 0)
    *   `price_per_adult_per_night` (decimal, precision: 10, scale: 2, null: false)
    *   `price_per_kid_under_2_per_night` (decimal, precision: 10, scale: 2, default: 0)
    *   `price_per_kid_under_12_per_night` (decimal, precision: 10, scale: 2, null: false)
    *   `vat_rate` (decimal, precision: 5, scale: 2, null: false)
    *   `subtotal` (decimal, precision: 10, scale: 2, nullable: true) # Calculated/cached
    *   `vat_amount` (decimal, precision: 10, scale: 2, nullable: true) # Calculated/cached
    *   `total_price` (decimal, precision: 10, scale: 2, nullable: true) # Calculated/cached
    *   `invoice_number` (string, nullable, unique)
    *   `invoice_generated_at` (:utc_datetime, nullable)
    *   `inserted_at`, `updated_at`
*   Add unique index on `booking_invoices` table for `booking_id` column.
*   Add unique index on `booking_invoices` table for `invoice_number` column.
*   The invoicing system should have:
    *   A `booking_invoice` table that acts as a "header" (stores invoice_number, invoice_generated_at, cached totals).
    *   A `booking_invoice_items` table that stores individual line items (name, quantity, price_per_night, vat_rate).
    *   A `quantity` field for each line item.
    *   Automatically create default line items (Adults, Kids under 2, Kids under 12) that can be edited/removed when creating an invoice for a booking.
    *   Per-item VAT for flexibility (in case you add extras with different rates).
    *   Cache the total on the `booking_invoice` header.
*   The quantity field in `booking_invoice_items` must allow zero values.
*   Add `item_type` (string, default: "person", null: false) to the `booking_invoice_items` table, and create an index on this column. The `item_type` field should be validated to be either "person" or "extra".
*   When calculating occupancy, use the `booking_invoice_items` table and filter by `item_type = "person"` to count the number of people booked for a given date.
*   The cottage capacity is 45 people. This value is hardcoded in the `CozyCheckout.Bookings` module.
*   When displaying the calendar view, show the total number of booked people for each day, color-coded against the capacity limit.
    *   ðŸŸ¢ Green (0-29): Plenty of space
    *   ðŸŸ¡ Yellow (30-39): Getting full
    *   ðŸŸ  Orange (40-44): Almost full
    *   ðŸ”´ Red (45+): At/over capacity
*   When displaying numbers in invoice items, use proper formatting, including thousand separators.
*   Ensure that numbers in invoice items do not wrap. The booking form may need to be wider to accommodate this.
*   After creating a new booking in the admin section, redirect to the booking detail page (`/admin/bookings/:id`) instead of the booking index page. Use `push_navigate` for this redirect.
*   **When implementing sorting, pagination, and filtering in admin tables:** Attempt to use the Flop library, creating reusable table components for filtering, sorting, and pagination, keeping the business logic separate from the UI, and making it easily reusable for other tables. However, due to version incompatibilities, it may be necessary to implement Flop without `flop_phoenix`, building the table components manually. If `flop_phoenix` can't be used, ensure that the filter parameters are properly encoded in the URL. If errors occur due to nil values, add guards to handle empty results.
*   Orders can be created without a booking or guest, using an "order name" to identify the order. This provides flexibility when bookings are made for only one person, and there's no need to add all guests to the system. These standalone orders must be payable via the POS system.
*   In the `orders` table, `guest_id` and `booking_id` are nullable to support standalone orders.
*   The `name` field is the primary identifier for standalone orders. Examples include:
    *   "Kids - Room 5"
    *   "Staff order"
    *   "Walk-in customer"
*   Orders must have either a `guest_id` OR a `name`.
*   When implementing product selection in pricelists, use a modern autocomplete search component with the following features:
    *   Real-time filtering with a debounce of 300ms.
    *   Search by product name or category name.
    *   Limit results to 10 items.
    *   Display selected product as a card with a check icon, product name, category name, and clear button.
    *   Use a dropdown for results, showing product name, category, and unit badge.
    *   Implement proper state management for products, filtered results, selected product, and search query.
    *   Utilize daisyUI components for styling.
    *   Ensure the component is responsive and accessible.
    *   Initially display at least 20 products even without search.
    *   Ensure the component is responsive and accessible.
*   When using `phx-change` on an input, the input element needs a `name` attribute for `phx-change` to work properly.
*   When displaying the orders index table, include the `orders.name` field. When `guest_id` is `nil`, display the `name` field with a "Standalone" badge. Use the following logic:
    ```elixir
    <%= if order.booking_id do %>
      {order.booking && order.booking.guest && order.booking.guest.name}
    <% else %>
      <span class="flex items-center gap-2">
        <span class="px-2 inline-flex text-xs leading-5 font-semibold rounded-full bg-purple-100 text-purple-800">
          Standalone
        </span>
        <span class="font-medium text-gray-900">{order.name}</span>
      </span>
    <% end %>
    ```
*   When implementing Flop filtering and sorting in the orders index:
    *   The following fields should be filterable:
        *   `status` (open, paid, partially_paid, cancelled)
        *   `name` (for standalone orders)
        *   `guest_id`
        *   `order_number` (use case-insensitive pattern match (ILIKE) instead of exact equality.)
        *   `inserted_at` (date range for when orders were created)
        *   Guest Name (searches in the associated booking's guest name)
    *   The following fields should be sortable:
        *   `inserted_at`
        *   `status`
    *   The default sorting should be by `desc: o.inserted_at` (newest first).
*   To force the application to always use the light theme:
    *   Modify the JavaScript in `root.html.heex` to always set the theme to "light". Remove the localStorage checks and system preference detection, and remove the event listeners for theme switching.
    *   Update the daisyUI configuration in `app.css` to change `prefersdark: true` to `prefersdark: false` in the dark theme configuration. This prevents the dark theme from being applied when the browser has a dark mode preference.
*   When displaying guest names in the Pohoda export, use the following logic to handle standalone orders:
    *   In the template (`index.html.heex`), add a conditional check: `<%= if order.booking_id do %>`
    *   If the order has a booking, display the guest name: `{order.booking.guest.name}`
    *   If it's a standalone order, display a "Standalone" badge with the order name: `{order.name}`. This matches the styling used in the orders index page.
    *   In the Pohoda module (`pohoda.ex`), replace direct access `order.booking.guest.name` with a helper function call: `get_customer_name(order)`
    *   Add a new helper function `get_customer_name/1` that:
        *   Returns the guest name if the order has a booking with a guest
        *   Returns the order name for standalone orders
        *   Falls back to "Unknown Customer" if neither is available
*   **POS System - Product Pricing Adjustments:** Implement an "Edit Price" button next to each order item in the POS system. Clicking this button should:
    *   Show the current total price (quantity Ã— unit_price).
    *   Allow staff to override the total price for that line item.
    *   Store both `original_price` and `actual_price` in the `order_items` table.
    *   Clearly indicate when a price has been adjusted (e.g., with a badge or highlight).
*   **Pricelist - Price Tiers**: Instead of storing a single price in `pricelist_items`, store multiple price tiers based on `unit_amount`.
    *   The `pricelist_items` table should have a `price_tiers` column of type `jsonb` that stores an array of price tiers. Example: `[%{unit_amount: 300, price: 45.00}, %{unit_amount: 500, price: 70.00}]`
    *   Keep the old `price` column for backwards compatibility initially. It can be removed later after migration.
    *   Create a GIN index on the `price_tiers` column: `create index(:pricelist_items, [:price_tiers], using: :gin)`.
    *   The `PricelistItem` schema should have a `price_tiers` field of type `{:array, :map}, default: []`.
    *   The `PricelistItem` changeset should validate the `price_tiers` field:
        *   It can't be blank.
        *   It must have at least one price tier.
        *   Each price tier must be a map with `unit_amount` (number > 0) and `price` (number >= 0).
    *   Add a `get_price_for_amount/2` helper function to the `PricelistItem` module to get the price for a specific unit amount.
*   In the pricelist item form in the admin UI, show all `default_unit_amounts` from the product and allow setting prices for each.
*   **POS System - No Custom Amounts:** The POS system should not allow entering custom amounts for products. Only predefined amounts from the product's `default_unit_amounts` should be available for selection. If a product does not have `default_unit_amounts`, the system should function as it currently does.
*   **Pricelist - Price Tiers**: Instead of storing a single price in `pricelists`, store multiple price tiers based on `unit_amount`.
    *   The `pricelists` table has a `price_tiers` column of type `jsonb` that stores an array of price tiers. Example: `[%{"unit_amount" => 300, "price" => 45.00}, %{"unit_amount" => 500, "price" => 70.00}]`
    *   The old `price` column is kept for backwards compatibility for products without `default_unit_amounts`.
    *   There is a GIN index on the `price_tiers` column for efficient querying.
    *   The `Pricelist` schema has a `price_tiers` field of type `{:array, :map}, default: []`.
    *   The `Pricelist` changeset validates that either `price` or `price_tiers` must be set.
    *   Each price tier must be a map with `unit_amount` (number > 0) and `price` (number >= 0).
    *   The `Pricelist.get_price_for_amount/2` function gets the price for a specific unit amount.
    *   The `Catalog.get_price_for_product/3` function gets the price for a product with a specific unit amount.
    *   In the pricelist form, if a product has `default_unit_amounts`, show all amounts and allow setting prices for each. If not, show a single price field.
    *   In the POS system, when adding items, the correct price is fetched from `price_tiers` based on the selected unit amount.
*   When editing pricelists, the product autocomplete should only be shown when creating a new pricelist, not when editing an existing one. The product selection should be disabled (not just the dropdown hidden) when editing.
*   In the pricelists index page, show the price tiers as well as the price in the price column. If price tiers are available, display them (e.g., "300: 45 CZK, 500: 70 CZK"). If not, display the single price (e.g., "50 CZK"). If no price is set, display "â€”".
    *   Use the `format_number/1` helper function from `CozyCheckoutWeb.CurrencyHelper` to format numbers with thousand separators.
    *   If price tiers are available, display them (e.g., "300: 45 CZK, 500: 70 CZK"), formatting the unit amounts using `format_number/1`.
    *   If not, display the single price (e.g., "50 CZK"), formatting the price using `format_currency/1`.
    *   If no price is set, display "â€”".
*   In the POS, when showing products, display their prices. If they have just one price, show it on the product card. When they have tiers, show prices in the tiers choice.
*   **Printable Pricelist Feature:**
    *   **Access Point:** Add a "Print Pricelist" button in the admin pricelists index page, and create a dedicated route like `/admin/pricelists/print` that can be accessed from the admin dashboard.
    *   **Layout Style:** Use a modern table format with columns for Product, Unit/Size, and Price. Implement a two-column layout on a page to save more space and fit more information on one page.
    *   **Pricelist Inclusion:** Only include active pricelists (those currently valid).
    *   **Additional Information:** Include the cottage name ("JindÅ™ichÅ¯v dÅ¯m") and the company name and IÄŒO in the footer ("MoruÅ¡ka s.r.o. - IÄŒO: 23741457").
    *   **Format Preferences:** Use portrait orientation, multiple pages if needed, and include the generated date. Page numbers are not needed.
    *   When generating the printable pricelist, use `Date.utc_today()` for the generated date to avoid timezone conversion issues.
*   **Printable Pricelist Display Format for Tiers:** When showing prices for tiers in the printable pricelist, display them in the following format: `name_of_product (tier1/tier2) tier prices separated by / in same order as tiers`. For example: `Product Name (300/500 ml) 45/70 CZK`.
*   **Category Ordering**:
    *   Add an integer `order` field to the `categories` table.
    *   When adding this field, existing categories should get sequential numbers (1, 2, 3...) based on their `inserted_at`.
    *   The UI for changing the category order should be in the category edit form as a number input.
    *   If two categories have the same order number, use the category name as a secondary sort.
    *   When creating a new category, it should default to the highest order number + 1 (put at the end).
    *   This new order should replace the current sorting completely in the POS.
