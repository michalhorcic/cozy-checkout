# Disabling editing and deletion of paid orders (2025-10-16 19:04Z)

_**User (2025-10-16 19:08Z)**_

in admin part where you can edit orders, disable it for paid orders. Those shouldn't be changed at all. They serve as history for accounting

I'll help you disable editing for paid orders in the admin section. Let me first explore the relevant files to understand the current implementation. Now let me check the router to see which routes are related to editing orders: Now I'll implement the changes to disable editing for paid orders. I need to:

1. Update the `Edit` LiveView to redirect paid orders
2. Update the `Show` LiveView to hide the "Edit Order" button for paid orders
3. Update the `Index` LiveView to prevent editing paid orders

Let's start: 
```

```

```

```
Now let's update the Index view to prevent editing paid orders from the list: The Index view doesn't have an "Edit" link directly - it only has "View" and "Delete" links. Let's verify this and also check if we need to prevent deletion of paid orders: Good! The Index view only has View and Delete links. Since paid orders should serve as accounting history, we should also prevent deletion of paid orders. Let me update both the template and the handler: 
```

```

```

```
Now let's update the `AGENTS.md` file to document this rule: Great! I can see the rule is already documented in the copilot instructions file. Now let's test the changes to make sure everything works correctly: Perfect! Let me create a summary of the changes I've made:

## Summary

I've successfully disabled editing and deletion of paid orders in the admin section. Here's what was changed:

### Changes Made:

1. **`OrderLive.Edit` (`edit.ex`)**
   - Added a check in the `mount/3` function to prevent accessing the edit page for paid orders
   - If a paid order is accessed, the user is redirected to the order show page with an error message: "Cannot edit paid orders. They serve as accounting history."

2. **`OrderLive.Show` (`show.ex`)**
   - Conditionally hides the "Edit Order" button for paid orders
   - Shows a locked icon with the text "Locked for accounting" instead when the order status is "paid"

3. **`OrderLive.Index` (`index.ex`)**
   - Updated the `handle_event("delete", ...)` function to prevent deletion of paid orders
   - Returns an error message if deletion is attempted: "Cannot delete paid orders. They serve as accounting history."
   - Updated the template to hide the "Delete" link for paid orders and show a locked icon instead

### Behavior:

- **Paid orders are now immutable** - they cannot be edited or deleted through the admin interface
- Users attempting to edit paid orders will be redirected with a clear error message
- The UI clearly indicates which orders are locked by:
  - Hiding edit/delete buttons
  - Showing a lock icon with explanatory text
  - Displaying tooltips explaining why the order is locked

This ensures that paid orders serve as permanent accounting history and cannot be accidentally modified or removed.
