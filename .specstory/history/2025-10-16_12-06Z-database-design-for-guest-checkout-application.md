# Database design for guest checkout application (2025-10-16 12:06Z)

_**User (2025-10-16 12:28Z)**_

We are going to create simple application for cashing out guests on mountain cottage. Especially for sold things on bar (beer, drinks and small snacks). I need to be able to manage available products, with pricelists. Then I need to be able to create orders for specific guests - guests should have own table for future expansions of application. Every order will list of items. I want to log payments of orders as well in separate table. As for now there will be no connection to bank or payment system. I will be handling payments manually. Most of them will be in cash or qr payments. Can you design database for this purpose? Please ask any additional questions to make it clear for you.

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5)**_

I'll help you design a database schema for your mountain cottage checkout system. Let me ask a few clarifying questions to ensure I understand your needs:

## Clarifying Questions:

1. **Products & Pricing:**
   - Do you need to track inventory/stock levels for products?
   - Can a product have multiple prices over time (price history), or just one active price at a time?
   - Do you need categories for products (e.g., "Beer", "Soft Drinks", "Snacks")?

2. **Orders & Items:**
   - Should each order item track the price at the time of purchase (in case prices change)?
   - Do you need to support discounts or special pricing for certain guests?
   - Can an order be partially paid over multiple payments?

3. **Payments:**
   - Do you need to track payment methods (cash, QR code, bank transfer)?
   - Should you be able to mark an order as "paid" vs "partially paid" vs "unpaid"?
   - Do you need to track who processed the payment (if multiple staff members)?

4. **Guests:**
   - What information do you need to store about guests (name, room number, contact info)?
   - Do guests check in/out on specific dates?
   - Should you be able to see a guest's order history?

5. **General:**
   - Do you need soft deletes (keeping deleted records) or hard deletes?
   - Do you need audit trails (who created/updated records and when)?
   - Any tax or VAT calculations needed on orders?

## Proposed Initial Schema:

Based on typical requirements for such a system, here's what I'm thinking:

```
guests
  - id (uuid, pk)
  - name (string, required)
  - room_number (string, nullable)
  - phone (string, nullable)
  - notes (text, nullable)
  - inserted_at, updated_at

products
  - id (uuid, pk)
  - name (string, required)
  - description (text, nullable)
  - category (string, nullable)
  - active (boolean, default: true)
  - inserted_at, updated_at

pricelists
  - id (uuid, pk)
  - product_id (uuid, fk -> products)
  - price (decimal, required)
  - valid_from (date, required)
  - valid_to (date, nullable)
  - active (boolean, default: true)
  - inserted_at, updated_at

orders
  - id (uuid, pk)
  - guest_id (uuid, fk -> guests)
  - order_number (string, unique, auto-generated)
  - status (string: "open", "paid", "cancelled")
  - total_amount (decimal, calculated)
  - notes (text, nullable)
  - inserted_at, updated_at

order_items
  - id (uuid, pk)
  - order_id (uuid, fk -> orders)
  - product_id (uuid, fk -> products)
  - quantity (integer, required)
  - unit_price (decimal, required - captured at order time)
  - subtotal (decimal, calculated: quantity * unit_price)
  - inserted_at, updated_at

payments
  - id (uuid, pk)
  - order_id (uuid, fk -> orders)
  - amount (decimal, required)
  - payment_method (string: "cash", "qr_code", "bank_transfer", etc.)
  - payment_date (date, default: today)
  - notes (text, nullable)
  - inserted_at, updated_at
```

Does this structure align with your needs? Please answer the questions above so I can refine the schema before generating the migrations and contexts.

_**User (2025-10-16 12:35Z)**_

Schema looks good. Now to answer your questions:
1. no need for stock - that is handled in accounting software; one active price at a time; and yes i want categories
2. yes, track the price at the time of purchase, just to be sure; yes discounts would be nice; yes i can be paid over multiple payments
3. yes, track the method; system should know automatically if it is paid or partially paid based on amount of order already paid; no staff tracking needed
4. what you proposed in schema for guest is enough for now; yes they do check in and out on specific dates; yes show guests order history
5. use just soft deletes; no audit needed for now; yes every product will have specified VAT in pricelist.

Perfect! Based on your answers, here's the refined database schema:

## Key Features:

1. **Soft deletes** - All tables have `deleted_at` field with indexes
2. **Categories** - Separate table for product categories
3. **VAT tracking** - VAT rate stored in both pricelists and order_items (captured at order time)
4. **Discounts** - `discount_amount` field in orders table
5. **Guest check-in/out** - Date fields added to guests table
6. **Payment tracking** - System can calculate payment status based on total payments vs order total
7. **Price history** - Price at time of purchase captured in order_items

The order status will be automatically determined by comparing the sum of payments against the order total amount. Would you like me to proceed with creating the Ecto schemas and contexts for these tables?

_**User (2025-10-16 12:40Z)**_

Looks perfect, now please create all those database schemas, migrate it into database and create simple CRUD interface so I am able to edit those data. Again ask any additional questions that comes to mind.

---

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5)**_

Perfect! I'll create the migrations, schemas, contexts, and CRUD interfaces. A few questions before I proceed:

1. **CRUD Interface priorities:** Should I create full CRUD for all tables, or start with the most important ones first? I'm thinking:
   - **Phase 1 (Essential):** Categories, Products, Pricelists, Guests
   - **Phase 2 (Operational):** Orders, Order Items, Payments
   
2. **Navigation:** Do you want a main dashboard/navigation menu to access all sections?

3. **Product management:** Should the pricelist be managed directly on the product form, or as a separate section?

4. **Order workflow:** For the orders CRUD:
   - Should creating an order allow adding items immediately in the same form?
   - Should there be a "checkout" or "finalize" action?
   - Should payment entry be part of the order form or separate?

5. **Payment methods:** What payment methods should be available in the dropdown? (e.g., "cash", "qr_code", "bank_transfer", "card")

For now, let me start by creating all the migrations and running them, then I'll create the schemas and contexts. Please answer the questions above so I can build the LiveView interfaces appropriately.

Let me start with the migrations: Great! Now let me run the migrations: Excellent! All migrations ran successfully. Now, while you answer my questions above, let me know your preferences so I can build the appropriate interfaces. 

In the meantime, would you like me to proceed with creating the Ecto schemas and basic contexts, or would you prefer to answer the questions first so I can tailor the CRUD interfaces to your exact workflow needs?

---

_**User (2025-10-16 12:49Z)**_

answering your questions:
1. create all that. you mentioned, both phases
2. yes, create menu to access all sections
3. separate section for priceslists is fine for now
4. yes allow adding items in the same form; no need for checkout now; payment entry doesnt need to be there yet. We will refine these workflows later
5. cash, qr_code

---

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5)**_

Perfect! Let me create all the schemas, contexts, and CRUD interfaces. I'll start with the schemas and contexts, then build the LiveView interfaces with navigation. Good! The schemas are created. The compile error will resolve once all schemas are loaded. Now let me create the context modules: Great! Now let me create the LiveView interfaces. I'll start with the main navigation/dashboard, then create the CRUD interfaces for each section: Now let me create the Categories LiveView CRUD: I need to check the core_components to see what modal component is available: Let me check what components are available: Let me continue reading to find if there's a modal component: I need to add a modal component. Let me first check the rest of core_components to understand the structure better, then add a modal component: Now let me add a modal component to core_components.ex: 
```

```
Now let me continue creating the rest of the CRUD LiveViews. First, let me create the Products LiveView: Now let me create the Pricelists, Guests, Orders, and Payments LiveViews. Due to the length, I'll create them in batches: Now let me create the Guests CRUD: Now let me create the Orders and Payments LiveViews. I'll create a simplified version for Orders first, and a basic Payments view: Now let me create the Order show page and Payment views. First the Order show: Now let me create the Payment views: Perfect! Now I need to add all the routes to the router. Let me update the router file: 
```

```
Great! Now let me check if there are any compilation errors and then start the server to test: I need to check if `simple_form` exists in core_components: I need to check what form components are available: Let me read more of the core_components file to see what form components exist: I see. The core_components uses daisy UI and doesn't have a `simple_form` component. I need to add one or use the form/input components directly. Let me add a simple_form component to core_components: Let me add a simple_form and header component before the input component: 

---

_**User (2025-10-16 12:50Z)**_

Check documentation for phoenix 1.8 and daisy UI which is part of new phoenix. That may be to reason why some components are missing. Check it properly and try to use daisy UI components.

---

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5)**_

You're absolutely right! Let me check the Phoenix 1.8 documentation and see what components are available with daisyUI. Let me look at the core_components more carefully: Perfect! I can see that Phoenix with daisyUI uses `<.form>` from Phoenix.Component and `<.input>` components directly, not `<.simple_form>`. The form component is built into Phoenix LiveView. Let me update all the form components to use the correct Phoenix.Component.form/1 and the existing `.input` component:
