# Making guest cards smaller in POS view (2025-10-16 19:58Z)

_**User (2025-10-16 20:04Z)**_

When selecting a guest in POS view, I would like to see more cards. Try to make them smaller. So we can fit more of them there.

I'll help you make the guest cards smaller in the POS view so more can fit on the screen. Let me first examine the current implementation. Now let me check the template file: Now I can see the guest cards. Let me make them more compact so more cards can fit on the screen. I'll reduce padding, font sizes, spacing, and minimum height while maintaining readability and touch-friendliness. 
```

```
Perfect! I've made the guest cards significantly more compact. Here's what I changed:

## Key improvements:

1. **Grid layout**: Changed from `grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 lg:grid-cols-4` to `grid-cols-3 md:grid-cols-4 lg:grid-cols-5 xl:grid-cols-6` - now you'll see 3-6 cards per row instead of 2-4

2. **Card size**: 
   - Reduced padding from `p-8` to `p-4`
   - Reduced min-height from `180px` to `120px`
   - Reduced gap between cards from `gap-6` to `gap-3`
   - Reduced border from `border-4` to `border-2`
   - Changed border radius from `rounded-2xl` to `rounded-xl`

3. **Typography & spacing**:
   - Guest name: `text-2xl mb-3` → `text-lg mb-2`
   - Room info: `text-lg gap-2 mb-2` → `text-sm gap-1.5 mb-1.5`
   - Icons: Reduced from `w-5 h-5` to `w-4 h-4` (and `w-3.5 h-3.5` for calendar)
   - Check-in dates: `text-sm` → `text-xs`
   - Badge: Reduced padding and font sizes

4. **Header**: 
   - Made slightly smaller (`text-4xl` → `text-3xl`, `text-lg` → `text-base`)
   - Reduced bottom margin from `mb-8` to `mb-4`

The cards are now much more compact while still maintaining good touch targets (minimum 44px is preserved) and readability. You should be able to see significantly more guests on the screen at once!
