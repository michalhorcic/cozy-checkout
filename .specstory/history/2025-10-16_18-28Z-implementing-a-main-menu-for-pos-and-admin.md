# Implementing a main menu for POS and admin (2025-10-16 18:28Z)

_**User (2025-10-16 18:33Z)**_

Add a simple menu that will enable switching between POS part of the system and admin part. Remove navigation card to pos system from current dashboard. That dashboard should live in /admin route, then create that menu where user will be able to switch between admin dashboard and pos system.

I'll help you create a menu to switch between the POS and admin sections, and reorganize the routes accordingly. Let me first explore the current structure to understand how things are set up. Now let me check the POS live files to understand the structure: Now I'll create a plan and implement the changes: Now let me create the main menu LiveView: Now let me update the router: 
```

```
Now let me update the dashboard to remove the POS card and update the styling: 
```

```
Now let me add a "Back to Menu" link to the POS guest selection page: 
```

```
Perfect! Now let me verify the changes by checking if there are any compilation errors: Excellent! Now let me create a summary of the changes:

## Summary

I've successfully implemented a main menu system for your Cozy Checkout application. Here's what was changed:

### 1. **Created Main Menu** (`main_menu_live.ex`)
   - New LiveView at the root path (`/`) with a beautiful dark-themed interface
   - Two large, touch-friendly cards for navigation:
     - **POS System** (emerald/teal gradient) - Links to `/pos`
     - **Admin Dashboard** (blue/indigo gradient) - Links to `/admin`
   - Smooth hover effects and scaling animations

### 2. **Updated Router** (`router.ex`)
   - Root path (`/`) now shows the main menu
   - Created new `/admin` scope for all admin functions
   - Dashboard moved from `/` to `/admin`
   - All admin routes updated with `/admin` prefix:
     - `/admin/categories`, `/admin/products`, `/admin/pricelists`
     - `/admin/guests`, `/admin/orders`, `/admin/payments`
     - `/admin/pohoda-export`

### 3. **Updated Admin Dashboard** (`dashboard_live.ex`)
   - Removed the POS System card
   - Changed title to "Admin Dashboard"
   - Added "Back to Menu" button in the header
   - Updated all navigation links to use `/admin` prefix

### 4. **Enhanced POS Navigation** (`guest_selection.html.heex`)
   - Added "Menu" button in the header to return to the main menu
   - Maintains touch-friendly design

### User Flow
1. User visits `/` â†’ sees main menu with two options
2. Clicks **POS System** â†’ goes to `/pos` for quick order management
3. Clicks **Admin Dashboard** â†’ goes to `/admin` for full system management
4. Both sections have buttons to return to the main menu

The design is clean, modern, and provides a clear separation between the touch-friendly POS interface and the comprehensive admin section! ðŸŽ‰
