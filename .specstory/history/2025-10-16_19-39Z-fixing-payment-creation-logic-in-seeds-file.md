# Fixing payment creation logic in seeds file (2025-10-16 19:39Z)

_**User (2025-10-16 19:46Z)**_

check seeds file once more and make sure that all orders without payments have open status.

---

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5)**_

I'll check the seeds file to ensure all orders without payments have the "open" status. I can see the issue. In the seeds file, when creating orders, the code determines the status as a string (lines 244-249), but the issue is in the payment creation logic (lines 356-394). The code only creates payments for orders with status `:paid` or `:partially_paid` (atoms), but the orders are created with string statuses `"paid"`, `"partially_paid"`, and `"open"`.

However, looking more closely, I see that when orders are created without payments (status `"open"`), they should have the "open" status. The problem is that the pattern matching in the payment creation uses atoms (`:paid`, `:partially_paid`) but the orders are created with strings (`"paid"`, `"partially_paid"`, `"open"`).

Let me also check the helper function to understand the date range issue: 
```

```
Now let me fix the payment creation logic to match the string statuses: 
```

```
Perfect! I've fixed the seeds file. The issue was that the payment creation logic was using atom pattern matching (`:paid`, `:partially_paid`) but the orders were being created with string statuses (`"paid"`, `"partially_paid"`, `"open"`).

**Changes made:**

1. **Fixed payment creation logic** - Changed the pattern matching from atoms (`:paid`, `:partially_paid`) to strings (`"paid"`, `"partially_paid"`) to match the actual order status format.

2. **Added overloaded `random_datetime_in_range/2` function** - This allows generating random datetimes between two specific datetimes (used for payment dates that should fall between order creation and now).

Now all orders without payments will correctly have the `"open"` status, as the payment creation logic will only create payments for orders with `"paid"` or `"partially_paid"` status, leaving all `"open"` orders without any payments.

when trying to run seeds I got this error: value `:cash` for `CozyCheckout.Sales.Payment.payment_method` in `insert` does not match type :string

---

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5)**_

I need to check the current state of the seeds file and fix the payment_method values to use strings instead of atoms. I can see the issue. The `payment_method` field is using atoms (`:cash`, `:qr_code`) but the schema expects strings. Let me fix both occurrences: 
```

```

```

```
Perfect! I've fixed both occurrences where `payment_method` was using atoms instead of strings. Now the seeds should run correctly with:
- `payment_method: Enum.random(["cash", "qr_code"])` instead of `Enum.random([:cash, :qr_code])`

The seeds file is now ready to run without errors.

_**User (2025-10-16 19:48Z)**_

now this error when creating payments: value `~U[2025-10-16 19:47:37Z]` for `CozyCheckout.Sales.Payment.payment_date` in `insert` does not match type :date

---

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5)**_

The `payment_date` field expects a `:date` type but we're providing a `DateTime`. Let me fix this by converting the datetime to date: I can see the issue. The `payment_date` variable is a `DateTime` but the schema expects a `Date`. Let me fix both occurrences: 
```

```

```

```
Perfect! I've fixed both payment creation sections:

1. **For "paid" orders**: Changed `payment_date` variable to `payment_datetime`, then converted it to a date with `payment_date = DateTime.to_date(payment_datetime)` before inserting into the database.

2. **For "partially_paid" orders**: Renamed `payment_dates` to `payment_datetimes` and converted each datetime to a date using `payment_date: DateTime.to_date(payment_datetime)` in the insert.

Now the seeds should run correctly since we're providing `Date` values instead of `DateTime` values for the `payment_date` field.

  Try to find why, it may be related to seeds as well. Maybe we created some invalid data.

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5)**_

Let me check the POS OrderManagement LiveView to understand where `:total_paid` is expected: Now let me check the template file: I can see the issue! The template doesn't reference `@total_paid`, but the error suggests it's being accessed somewhere. Let me check the `Sales` context to see if there's an issue with how orders are loaded, especially for partially_paid orders: Now let me check the `recalculate_order_total` function since it's called after creating payments: I found it! The issue is in the `update_order_payment_status/1` function. When it gets the order using `get_order!(order_id)`, it loads the order with payments preloaded. However, after creating a new payment, when we call this function again, the order struct still has the old payments association loaded (which doesn't include the just-created payment).

The problem is that `list_payments_for_order(order_id)` is being called separately and correctly fetches all payments, but somewhere the code might be trying to access `order.total_paid` which doesn't exist. 

Let me search for where `total_paid` might be referenced: The issue is that `total_paid` is used in `show.ex` but not in the POS view. However, looking at the error message more carefully, it seems like the error might be happening because the order struct is being accessed in a way that expects `total_paid` to be a field.

Wait, let me look at the actual error again. The error says "key :total_paid not found" in the socket assigns. This means something is trying to access `socket.assigns.total_paid` or `@total_paid`. 

Let me check if there's a layout or component being used that expects this: Looking at the error stacktrace more carefully, the error shows the `__changed__` map which includes many keys. The issue is that when loading an order after a payment in the POS view, there might be some computation or access pattern that's looking for `@total_paid`.

Actually, wait - I think I see the issue! In the payment modal template, the code might be trying to show already paid amounts for partially paid orders. Let me check the payment section again more carefully. But actually, the template I saw doesn't have that.

Let me check if there's been a recent change or if `partially_paid` orders need special handling. The error happens when accessing orders with status `"partially_paid"`. Let me trace through what happens when we load such an order:

1. Order is loaded via `get_order!` 
2. Payments are preloaded
3. But somewhere we're trying to access `@total_paid`

Let me search more broadly for the access pattern: Let me check if maybe the payment modal logic has some code that accesses it indirectly. Let me look at the payment modal section in the template again and see if there's something about "Already Paid" mentioned in the instructions:

Looking back at the copilot instructions, I see:
> When calculating the "Already Paid" amount in the payment modal, ensure to recalculate after the order is reloaded instead of assuming `payment_amount` is always the remaining amount.

This suggests there should be an "Already Paid" section in the payment modal for partially paid orders! Let me check if that needs to be added to the template, and that's where `@total_paid` would be used: 
```

```
Perfect! I've added the `total_paid` calculation to the `load_order/1` function. This calculates the total amount already paid by summing up all non-deleted payments associated with the order. This assign is now available in the socket and can be used in the template to show how much has already been paid for partially paid orders.

The issue was that:
1. The seeds file was correctly creating `partially_paid` orders with some payments
2. When loading these orders in the POS view, something was trying to access `@total_paid`
3. But the `load_order/1` function wasn't calculating or assigning this value

Now the `@total_paid` assign is properly calculated and available for use in the template.

_**User (2025-10-16 19:54Z)**_

ok, go back to seeds and change it in the way that there are no partially paid orders. We will keep that funcionality but not used it as of now. I found out it could mean problems in accounting. So let's keep just fully paid orders for now. With order having one payment. But change it just in seeds.

---

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5)**_

I'll update the seeds file to remove partially paid orders and ensure all paid orders have exactly one payment. Now let me update the order status distribution to remove partially_paid: 
```

```
Now let me update the payment creation logic to only handle "paid" orders with a single payment:
