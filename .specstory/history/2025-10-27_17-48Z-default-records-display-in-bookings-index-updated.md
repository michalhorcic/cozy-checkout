I'll help you modify the bookings index to show 100 records by default before pagination. Let me first check the current bookings index implementation. Now let me check the Bookings context to see where the default page size is set: Let me check the Flop schema configuration for the Booking model: Perfect! Now let me read the Booking schema file to update the default limit: Now I'll update the `default_limit` from 20 to 100 in the Booking schema: 
```

```
Perfect! I've updated the bookings index to show 100 records by default. The change was made in the `Booking` schema's Flop configuration, where I updated the `default_limit` from 20 to 100.

This means that:
- By default, the bookings index will now show 100 bookings per page
- Users can still navigate through pages if there are more than 100 bookings
- The `max_limit` remains at 100, which means users cannot request more than 100 records per page

The change is in the Flop.Schema configuration in `booking.ex` at line 13.
