# Implementing a calendar view for bookings in Elixir (2025-10-16 21:36Z)

_**User (2025-10-16 21:46Z)**_

Let's implement calendar view for our bookings. Check internet for best practices, maybe check if there is any useful library. Try to stay away from JS libraries though.

I'll help you implement a calendar view for bookings. Let me first search for best practices and check what's available in the Elixir/Phoenix ecosystem. Now let me check the existing booking context and look at best practices for calendar views in Phoenix LiveView: Great! Now let me implement a calendar view for bookings. Based on best practices for Phoenix LiveView and to avoid JavaScript dependencies, I'll create a pure Elixir/LiveView calendar implementation using Tailwind CSS for styling.

I'll create:
1. A new context function to get bookings for a specific month
2. A calendar LiveView component
3. Calendar helper functions to generate the calendar grid

Let me start: 
```

```
Now let's create a calendar helper module to generate the calendar grid: Now let's create the calendar LiveView: Now let's create the calendar template: Now let's create a component for the day cell: 
```

```
Now we need to add the CalendarHelpers alias to the template. Let's update the template to include the module alias properly: 
```

```
Now let's add the calendar route to the router: 
```

```
Now let's add a link to the calendar view in the bookings index page: 
```

```
Now let's also add a link to the calendar from the admin dashboard: Let's add a calendar card to the dashboard: 
```

```
Now let's test the calendar by starting the server: We need to fix the `current_scope` attribute - it should be a string, not an atom. Let's also check what the proper scope should be: Let me check the existing layouts and how they handle this: I see the issue. The `current_scope` attribute expects a `:map`, but we're passing an atom. Let me check how other templates handle this: It looks like other LiveViews don't use the `<Layouts.app>` wrapper. They just have the content directly. Let me check one of them: I see - the templates don't use the `<Layouts.app>` wrapper. Let me update the calendar template to match the pattern: 
```

```
I need to remove the closing tag as well: 
```

```
Let me read the full file to understand the structure: I see the issue - there's an extra closing div. Let me fix it: 
```

```
Good! Now let's also fix the indentation issue with the rest of the template: 
```

```
Now let's compile again: [object Object]

Great! Now let's start the server and test the calendar view: Excellent! The server is running. Now let's open the browser to test the calendar:
