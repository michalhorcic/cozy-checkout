Bookings can have long notes for now, which is great. I want to add short note which will be displayed in bookings index as a badge. Keep it short, maybe not longer than 30 characters. It will be used to visually group some bookings. Sometimes people are coming in a group but they have more bookings for invoicing.

I'll help you add a short note field to bookings that will be displayed as a badge in the bookings index. This will help visually group related bookings.

Let me start by examining the current bookings structure: Now let me check the bookings index view to see how it currently displays data: Now I'll create a migration to add the `short_note` field to the bookings table, update the schema and changeset, and modify the index view to display it as a badge. Let me start: Now let me write the migration: 
```

```
Now let's update the Booking schema to include the short_note field: 
```

```
Now update the changeset to include short_note and add validation: 
```

```
Now let's check the booking form component to add the short_note field:
