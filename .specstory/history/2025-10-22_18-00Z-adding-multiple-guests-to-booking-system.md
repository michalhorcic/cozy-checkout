# Adding multiple guests to booking system (2025-10-22 18:00Z)

_**User (2025-10-22 18:03Z)**_

I need few things to add. I need to be able to add more guests to booking. Keep current relation and use it as primary guest. The one that will be added on booking creating is considered primary guest. Then User can add more guests to every booking. Keep it simple as possible. And do not update seeds file for now. Ask any additional questions if needed

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5)**_

I'll help you add the ability to have multiple guests per booking. Let me first understand the current structure better. Now let me check if there's an existing `booking_guests` table or similar: I can see there's documentation about `booking_guests` in the project history. Let me check if the table already exists:

_**User (2025-10-22 18:04Z)**_

ignore that for now. It didn't work as expected so it was dropped completely. Start from scratch

---

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5)**_

Perfect! Let me start from scratch and implement a clean solution for adding multiple guests to a booking. Let me ask a few clarifying questions to make sure I implement this correctly:

## Questions:

1. **UI Location**: Where should users add additional guests to a booking?
   - In the admin booking edit form?
   - A separate "Manage Guests" button/section on the booking detail page?
   - Both?

2. **Guest Information**: When adding additional guests to a booking, should we:
   - Select from existing guests in the database?
   - Create new guests on the fly?
   - Both options?

3. **Display**: How should we display multiple guests on a booking?
   - In the booking list/calendar view, should we show all guests or just the primary?
   - In the POS system guest selection, continue showing only the primary guest?

4. **Relationship Field**: For the additional guests, do you want to track the relationship field (like "adult", "child", "spouse", etc.) mentioned in the copilot instructions, or keep it even simpler without that?

5. **Deletion**: Should we allow removing additional guests from a booking (but never the primary guest)?

Please let me know your preferences and I'll implement the cleanest solution!

1. separate manage guests
2. both options
3. show only primary guest for now
4. no need to track relationships
5. yes allow removing additional one, keep primary

Perfect! Let me implement this step by step. I'll create:

1. A `booking_guests` join table
2. Schema and context functions
3. A "Manage Guests" interface in the admin section

Let's start: 
```

```
Now let's create the BookingGuest schema: Now update the Booking schema to include the association: 
```

```
Now update the Guest schema: 
```

```
Now let's update the Bookings context to add functions for managing booking guests: 
```

```

```

```
Now let's add functions for managing booking guests at the end of the Bookings context: 
```

```
Now let's run the migration: Great! Now let's create the LiveView for managing guests. First, let me check the structure of the admin booking views: Let me check if there are other admin liveviews: Let me check the booking show page to see where we should add the "Manage Guests" button: Perfect! Now let me create a "Manage Guests" LiveView. I'll create it as a modal that opens from the booking show page: Now let's add a "Manage Guests" button to the booking show page: 
```

```
Now let's add the route for the manage guests page. Let me check the router: 
```

```
Now let's test the implementation by starting the server: We have a warning about the `current_scope` attribute. Let me check how it's used in other views: Let me check another admin live view to see the pattern: I see, the other views don't use the `Layouts.app` wrapper. Let me check the booking show view again: The templates don't use the `Layouts.app` wrapper. Let me update the ManageGuests view to match the pattern: 
```

```

@agent Continue: "Continue to iterate?"

```

```
Now let's compile again: Good! Let's fix those warnings: 
```

```
Now let's start the server and test: Great! The server is running. Now let me create a summary document of what was implemented:

## Summary

I've successfully implemented the ability to add multiple guests to a booking! Here's what was done:

### 1. **Database Layer** âœ…
- Created `booking_guests` join table with migration
- Added `is_primary` flag to distinguish the primary guest
- Migrated existing bookings to automatically create primary guest records
- Added proper indexes for performance

### 2. **Schema & Context** âœ…
- Created `BookingGuest` schema (`booking_guest.ex`)
- Updated `Booking` schema with associations:
  - `has_many :booking_guests`
  - `has_many :additional_guests, through: [:booking_guests, :guest]`
- Updated `Guest` schema with `has_many :booking_guests`
- Modified `create_booking/1` to automatically create a primary guest record in a transaction
- Added context functions in `Bookings`:
  - `list_booking_guests/1` - lists all guests for a booking
  - `add_guest_to_booking/2` - adds a guest to a booking
  - `remove_guest_from_booking/1` - removes non-primary guests
  - `get_booking_guest!/1` - gets a single booking guest

### 3. **UI - Manage Guests Interface** âœ…
- Created new LiveView: `manage_guests.ex`
- Features:
  - **View all guests** for a booking (primary guest marked with badge)
  - **Add existing guests** - select from a list of all guests in the system
  - **Create new guests** on the fly with name, email, and phone
  - **Remove guests** - only non-primary guests can be removed
  - Already-added guests are hidden from the selection list
  - Clean, user-friendly interface with proper validation and error handling

### 4. **Navigation** âœ…
- Added "Manage Guests" button to booking show page
- Added route: `/admin/bookings/:booking_id/guests`
- Purple button to distinguish from edit button

### 5. **Key Features** âœ…
- Primary guest is protected and cannot be removed
- Duplicate prevention (can't add same guest twice)
- Both options available: select existing or create new
- Clean UI that shows only the primary guest in lists/calendar (as requested)
- Full CRUD for managing additional guests

### How to Use:
1. Navigate to any booking detail page in admin
2. Click the "Manage Guests" button (purple)
3. Add guests by either:
   - Selecting from existing guests in the database
   - Creating a new guest on the fly
4. Remove any additional guests (but not the primary one)

The implementation is clean, simple, and follows your existing code patterns. The primary guest relationship remains intact, and additional guests are managed through the join table. ðŸŽ‰

Looks ok, just fix the button for managing guests. For some reason it looks very ugly, not even like button

---

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5)**_

Let me check the button styling on the booking show page: The issue is that I'm trying to override the button background color with a class, but that might not work with the default button component. Let me check the button component definition: I see - the button uses daisyUI classes. Let me fix this by using a proper styled button without trying to override the color: 
```

```
Perfect! I've replaced the button with a properly styled link that uses Tailwind classes directly. This will give you a nice purple button that matches the style of the Edit Booking button, with:
- Purple background (`bg-purple-600`)
- Darker purple on hover (`hover:bg-purple-700`)
- White text
- Proper padding, rounded corners, and shadow
- Smooth transition effect

The button should now look much better and consistent with the rest of the UI! ðŸŽ¨
