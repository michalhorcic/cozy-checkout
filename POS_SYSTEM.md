# Point of Sale (POS) System

## Overview

The POS system is a touch-friendly interface designed for bar staff to quickly manage guest orders. It's optimized for iPad (11 inches and larger) and provides a fast, intuitive experience for day-to-day operations.

## Access

The POS system is accessible at `/pos` and is completely separate from the admin dashboard.

From the main dashboard, click the "üçπ POS System" card to access it.

## User Workflow

### 1. Guest Selection (`/pos`)
- **Large Touch Cards**: Each active guest is displayed as a large, tappable card
- **Guest Information**: Shows guest name, room number, and check-in period
- **Order Badge**: Displays the number of open orders for each guest
- **Auto-Navigation**: 
  - If guest has no orders ‚Üí automatically creates new order
  - If guest has 1 order ‚Üí opens that order directly
  - If guest has multiple orders ‚Üí shows order selection screen

### 2. Order Selection (`/pos/guests/:guest_id/orders`)
- Only shown when a guest has multiple open orders
- Displays all open orders with:
  - Order number

### 3. Order Management (`/pos/orders/:id`)

## Best Practices

### For Bar Staff
1. Always verify the guest name before adding items
2. Use the popular products tab for frequently ordered items
3. Swipe items to remove them quickly
4. Check the total before leaving the order screen
5. Return to guest selection when finished

### For Administrators
1. Keep categories organized and logically grouped
2. Ensure pricelists are active and up-to-date
3. Monitor popular products to optimize menu layout
4. Train staff on swipe gestures for efficiency
5. Regularly check orders for completeness

## Troubleshooting

**Problem**: Can't find a guest
- **Solution**: Check if guest is checked in (requires check-in date to be active)

**Problem**: Product prices showing as $0
- **Solution**: Ensure active pricelist exists for that product

**Problem**: Swipe gesture not working
- **Solution**: Ensure you're using a touch-enabled device; mouse doesn't support swipe

**Problem**: Order total not updating
- **Solution**: Refresh the page; recalculation happens on item add/remove

## Architecture Notes

The POS system is designed to be completely independent from the admin interface:
- Separate route namespace (`/pos`)
- Custom minimal layout (no admin navigation)
- Optimized queries for speed
- Touch-first interaction patterns
- No complex forms or text input

### Visual Grouping Implementation

Order items with the same product and unit amount are **visually grouped** for cleaner display:
- **Database**: Individual `order_items` records are maintained separately
- **Display**: Items are grouped by `product_id` and `unit_amount` for UI presentation
- **Benefits**: 
  - Maintains accurate audit trail (each add = separate record)
  - Cleaner cart display (reduces visual clutter)
  - Can expand to view/manage individual items
  - Preserves historical context for reporting
- **Implementation**: `OrderItemGrouper` helper module handles grouping logic
- **Both interfaces**: Grouping is used in both POS system and admin CRUD

This separation allows the admin interface to remain full-featured while keeping the POS system fast and simple for staff use.
