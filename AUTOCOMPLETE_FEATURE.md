# Product Autocomplete Feature

## Overview

The pricelist form now includes a user-friendly autocomplete search for products instead of a traditional dropdown select. This makes it much easier to find products when you have many items in your catalog.

## Features

### 🔍 Smart Search
- **Real-time filtering**: As you type, products are filtered instantly
- **Debounced input**: 300ms debounce prevents excessive filtering
- **Multi-field search**: Searches both product name and category name
- **Limit results**: Shows top 10 matches to keep the UI clean

### 🎨 Visual Design
- **daisyUI styling**: Consistent with the rest of the application
- **Search icon**: Visual indicator in the input field
- **Selected product card**: Clear display of the selected product with:
  - Check icon for confirmation
  - Product name
  - Category name (if available)
  - Clear button to deselect

### 📱 User Experience
- **Dropdown results**: Shows filtered products in a clean dropdown
  - Product name prominently displayed
  - Category shown as secondary information
  - Unit badge displayed if the product has a unit
- **No results message**: Clear feedback when no products match
- **Keyboard friendly**: Standard input navigation works
- **Touch friendly**: Large touch targets for mobile/tablet use

### 🔧 Technical Implementation

#### Component Structure
```elixir
# Private function component
defp product_autocomplete(assigns) do
  # Renders the autocomplete UI
end
```

#### State Management
The component tracks:
- `all_products`: Full list of products from the database
- `filtered_products`: Subset based on search query
- `selected_product`: Currently selected product (if any)
- `search_query`: Current search input value
- `show_dropdown`: Whether to display the dropdown

#### Event Handlers
1. **search_product**: Filters products as user types
2. **select_product**: Sets the selected product and updates the form
3. **clear_product**: Removes the selected product

#### Search Logic
```elixir
defp filter_products(products, query) do
  query_lower = String.downcase(query)
  
  products
  |> Enum.filter(fn product ->
    String.contains?(String.downcase(product.name), query_lower) ||
      (product.category && String.contains?(String.downcase(product.category.name), query_lower))
  end)
  |> Enum.take(10)
end
```

## Usage

1. Navigate to Admin → Pricelists → New Pricelist (or edit an existing one)
2. In the Product field, start typing the product name or category
3. Select from the filtered results
4. The selected product appears as a card below the input
5. Click the X button to clear and search again if needed

## Benefits

- **Faster product selection** when you have many products
- **Better UX** compared to scrolling through long dropdowns
- **Visual confirmation** of the selected product
- **Reduced errors** by showing category information

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Add recent selections
- Highlight matching text in results
- Add keyboard navigation (arrow keys, Enter to select)
- Show product image thumbnails
- Add barcode scanning capability
